# About
I will be using this as a personal Wiki for my homelab, self-hosted services and tech studies, also as a way to improve my technical documentation skills

## How was it created?
- Static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Deployed with a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub, site source code is available [here](https://github.com/addzey/addzey.dev)
- Using a fork of [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme with some customizations I've made like integrating FontAwesome, which is available [here](https://github.com/addzey/hugo-theme-terminal)

## What content will be here?
- Personal wiki articles
- Tech study
- Homelab projects
- Self-hosting guides
